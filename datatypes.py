if any variables with start with number 100 or 1 or 100000 with out any faction it is called as integer
x=100
print(x,type(x))

if any number having faction we call it as float
y=10.3456
print(y,type(y))

if ny datatype represents inside quotes we call it as string
my_name="my_name is kiran you all know that"
print(my_name,type(my_name))

we can convert datatypes 

we can convert any data type into boolean
boolean of any datatype is = True or False
boolean(empty) = False
boolean(non-empty)=Ture
this is if a value is holding 0 zeero it will be false it any values is holdeing other than 0 it will be true from -1 to infinity
  x=""
  bool(x) bool([])this is list,bool(()) this is tuple, bool({}) this is dictonary
   bool(none) these thing will be false only
   if we dont provide any thing it will be false only
   we can convert data types also from integer to string integer to boolean but we can't convert string to boolean

Any data type can be converted into string but the reversal is not alwways true number can be convert into string but the alphabeets can'bt be converted
